# Temrink Chatbot Knowledge Base

Put your reference documents here. The chatbot can use this folder to answer questions about services, pricing, licensing, and AI/automation.

Recommended structure:

- services/
  - overview.md
  - helpdesk.md
  - automation.md
  - device-as-a-service.md
- licensing/
  - microsoft-365.md
  - google-workspace.md
- pricing/
  - microsoft-365-business.md
  - copilot.md
- case-studies/
  - retail.md
  - finance.md

Guidelines:
- Prefer Markdown (.md) files
- Keep each file focused on one topic
- Use headings (##) and bullet points for scannability
- Include “last updated” at the top

Once files are added, update `manifest.json` to list them so the chatbot can index and surface the right snippets.
